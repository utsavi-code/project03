## Overview

### The challenge

- This project is a solution to the Frontend Mentor **Social Links Profile** challenge.  

- It’s a clean, responsive profile card page that showcases a user’s social links, avatar, and basic information.  

- The layout includes a profile image, user name, short bio, and social media buttons. The design uses Google Fonts for a modern and minimalist look.
